    /*
    A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
    This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

    Basic Operations
    #1. Push → Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    #2. Pop → Removes and returns the top element.
    #3. Peek (or Top) → Returns the top element without removing it.
    #4. isEmpty → Checks if the stack is empty.

    Use Cases of Stack
    #1. Function Call Stack → Used in recursion and method execution.
    #2. Undo/Redo Operations → Used in text editors and applications.
    #3. Expression Evaluation → Used in balancing parentheses, postfix evaluation, etc.
    #4. Depth-First Search (DFS) → Used in graph traversal.

    Stack Implementation Types
    1. Using Arrays → Fixed size, efficient access.
    2. Using Linked List → Dynamic size, extra memory for pointers.

    Key Characteristics
    #1. LIFO Principle → The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.
    #2. Dynamic Size → Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
    #3. Efficient Operations → Push and pop operations have O(1) time complexity.
    #4. Limited Access → Only the top element can be accessed directly.
    #5. Memory Utilization → Linked list implementation takes extra memory for pointers.
