        A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data in a way
        that enables efficient access and modification.
        It defines the relationship between the data, as well as the operations that can be performed
        on the data.

        Key Concepts in Data Structures:
            Organization of Data: How data is arranged for optimal use.
            Operations: Common operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and sorting.


        Classification of Data Structures:
            1. Primitive Data Structures:
                    A. Integer
                    B. Float
                    C. Character
                    D. Boolean

            2. Non-Primitive Data Structures:
                A. Linear Data Structures:
                    Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
                B. Non-Linear Data Structures:
                    Trees, Graphs.

            3. Abstract Data Types (ADTs):
                List, Queue, Deque, Set, Map.
