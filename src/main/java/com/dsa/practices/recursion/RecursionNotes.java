    Definition: A function that calls itself.
    Recursion is a fundamental programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a smaller
    instance of the same problem until it reaches a base condition.
    It is widely used in algorithm design, especially for problems involving hierarchical structures like trees and graphs.

    Characteristics of Recursion
    #1. Base Case: A stopping condition to prevent infinite recursion.
    #2. Recursive Case: A function calls itself with modified parameters.
    #3. Stack Usage: Each recursive call is stored in the call stack.
    #4. Divide and Conquer Approach: Problems are broken down into smaller subproblems.
    #5. Overlapping Subproblems: Some recursive problems can be optimized using memoization.


    Use Cases of Recursion
    #1. Mathematical Problems: Factorial, Fibonacci, GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).
    #2. Tree and Graph Traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS), Binary Tree Traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder).
    #3. Sorting Algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort.
    #4. Backtracking: Sudoku Solver, N-Queens Problem, Word Search.
    #5. Dynamic Programming: Solving problems like Knapsack, Coin Change with memoization.
    #6. File System Navigation: Recursively listing directories and files.
