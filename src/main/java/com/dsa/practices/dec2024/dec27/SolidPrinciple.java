    /*
        SOLID is a set of five principles in object-oriented programming designed to make code
        more maintainable, scalable, and robust.

        1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        Def: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.
        Key Idea: Each class should focus on a single task or functionality to ensure modularity
                  and reduce the risk of unexpected side effects.

        2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
        Def: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension
             but closed for modification.
        Key Idea: You should be able to add new functionality without altering existing
                  code to minimize risk.

        3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
        Def: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without
             affecting the correctness of the program.
        Key Idea: A subclass should not violate the behavior or expectations set by its parent class.

        4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
        Def: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
        Key Idea: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing
                classes only need to know about methods relevant to them.

         5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
         Def: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
              Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
        Key Idea: Depend on interfaces or abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

        Benefits of Following SOLID Principles:
        1. Improved Code Maintainability: Easier to modify and extend the code.
        2. Scalability: Better adaptability to new requirements.
        3. Reusability: Classes and modules can be reused in different contexts.
        4. Testability: Promotes writing testable code by reducing coupling.
        5. Readability: Clear and well-organized code.

        Quick Summary:
        SRP: One class, one responsibility.
        OCP: Extend, donâ€™t modify.
        LSP: Subclasses replace base classes.
        ISP: Split interfaces; no unused methods.
        DIP: Depend on abstractions, not implementations.
