    /*

        A singleton class in Java is a class that ensures only one instance of itself is created
        throughout the application's lifecycle. It provides a global access point to that instance.
        This design pattern is used when only one instance of a class is required,
        such as for managing shared resources like configuration settings, logging, or database connections.

        Key Characteristics of a Singleton Class
        1. Single Instance: Only one object is created.
        2. Global Access: Provides a way to access the single instance globally.
        3. Controlled Instance Creation: The class itself controls the instantiation process.

        Steps to Create a Singleton Class
        #1 Private Constructor: Prevents instantiation from outside the class.
        #2 Static Instance: Holds the single instance of the class.
        #3 Public Getter Method: Provides global access to the instance.
