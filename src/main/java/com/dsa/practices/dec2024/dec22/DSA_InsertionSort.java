    /*
        Insertion Sort is an algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly
        picking the next element from the unsorted part and placing it into the correct position in
        the sorted part.
        Itâ€™s like sorting a hand of playing cards: you start with an empty hand (sorted part) and
        add each new card by placing it in the correct position.

        Key Characteristics:
        1. Simple: Easy to implement and understand.
        2. In-Place: Sorts the array without extra space.
        3. Efficient for Small Datasets: Works well on small or partially sorted arrays.
        4. Stable: Maintains the order of equal elements.

        How Insertion Sort Works
        1. Start with the second element: The first element is already considered sorted because
        it's the only element in that part of the array.

        2. Pick the next element (key): You then look at the second element (key) and compare it with
        the previous element(s) in the sorted part.

        3. Shift elements if needed: If the key is smaller than the element before it,
        you shift that element to the right.

        4. Insert the key in the right place: Once the appropriate position is found (or no shift is needed),
        place the key element there.

        5. Repeat for each element: Move through all elements in the array, repeatedly placing
        each element in its correct sorted position.

        Time Complexity:
            Best Case: O(n)
            Worst Case: O(n^2) (when the list is sorted in reverse order).
            Average Case: O(^2)
