    /*
        Time Complexity: Refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its execution
        as a function of the input size.
        Measured in terms of basic operations or steps.

        Space Complexity: Refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute.
            Includes:
                Fixed part: Memory used by variables, constants, program code, etc.
                Variable part: Memory required for temporary or dynamic structures like recursion stack
                                or dynamic data structures.

        Big O Notation
            Constant Time     – O(1)     => Big O
            Logarithmic Time  - O(logN)  => Big O logN
            Linear Time       – O(n)     => Big O(N)
            Linearithmic Time - O(nlogn) => Big NlogN
            Quadratic Time    - O(n2)
            Exponential Time  - O(2n)
            Factorial Time    - O(n!)
